1. Can you take us through your military career, sharing notable experiences and accomplishments along the way?

2. What pivotal moment or realization inspired you to seek a new career outside the military, eventually leading you to our organization?

3. Describe the path that brought you to our veteran internship program. What made you decide to embark on this journey?

4. Share some specific skills and experiences from your military service that have proven to be invaluable in your role here. 

5. Reflect on the challenges you encountered during your transition from military life to corporate culture. How did you conquer these obstacles?

6. Tell us about the moment when you realized our organization's culture and mission resonated with you and made you want to be a part of it.

7. Narrate an outstanding project or achievement from your internship that you're particularly proud of and how it reflects your transition story.

8. Highlight how the veteran internship program has played a role in your growth and integration within our company.

9. Compare and contrast the military and corporate environments, sharing anecdotes of how your military background has been beneficial in adapting to this change.

10. Offer guidance for fellow veterans considering a career transition through a veteran internship program, drawing from your own experience.
