3. Describe the path that brought you to our veteran internship program. What made you decide to embark on this journey?

4. Share some specific skills and experiences from your military service that have proven to be invaluable in your role here. 

5. Reflect on the challenges you encountered during your transition from military life to corporate culture. How did you conquer these obstacles?
