Title: Set up platform for ML testing harness using mlflow

Description:

Create a platform for ML testing harness using mlflow. The platform should include the following components:

A central repository for storing ML models and experiment results
A mechanism for tracking and managing ML experiments
A way to automatically deploy ML models to production
Acceptance Criteria:

The platform must be able to store ML models and experiment results.
The platform must be able to track and manage ML experiments.
The platform must be able to automatically deploy ML models to production.
Subtask 1

Title: Install mlflow

Description:

Install mlflow on the development machine.

Acceptance Criteria:

mlflow must be installed successfully.
The mlflow command-line tool must be available.
Subtask 2

Title: Create a central repository for storing ML models and experiment results

Description:

Create a central repository for storing ML models and experiment results. The repository can be a local directory, a cloud storage service, or a database.

Acceptance Criteria:

The repository must be created successfully.
The repository must be accessible to all users who need to store ML models and experiment results.
Subtask 3

Title: Configure mlflow to track and manage ML experiments

Description:

Configure mlflow to track and manage ML experiments. This includes setting up experiment tracking, logging, and metrics.

Acceptance Criteria:

mlflow must be configured to track and manage ML experiments.
Experiment tracking, logging, and metrics must be enabled.
Subtask 4

Title: Deploy ML models to production

Description:

Deploy ML models to production. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as Docker, Kubernetes, or AWS Lambda.

Acceptance Criteria:

ML models must be deployed to production successfully.
The deployed models must be accessible to users.











Create a sample script that can be used to capture parameters, metrics, and artifacts from a sandbox environment. The script should be able to:

Capture all parameters, metrics, and artifacts that are relevant to the sandbox environment.
Store the captured data in a central location.
Generate reports that can be used to analyze the captured data.
Acceptance Criteria:

The script must be able to capture all parameters, metrics, and artifacts that are relevant to the sandbox environment.
The captured data must be stored in a central location.
The script must be able to generate reports that can be used to analyze the captured data.
Subtasks

Identify the parameters, metrics, and artifacts that need to be captured.
Develop the script that will capture the data.
Test the script and make sure it works correctly.
Deploy the script to the sandbox environment.
Document the script so that other users can use it.






processes, we recognize the need for a robust and efficient ML testing harness. The purpose of this epic is to develop a comprehensive ML testing harness that enables automated testing and validation of ML models throughout their lifecycle.

The ML testing harness will provide a unified platform to facilitate the testing and evaluation of ML models, covering areas such as accuracy, performance, fairness, robustness, and reliability. It will support both traditional ML models and deep learning models.
