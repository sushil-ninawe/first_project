The migration will be executed in a phased approach:

Assessment Phase: Identify all systems, applications, and dependencies relying on Python 3.7.5.
Development Phase: Update and test individual components in isolated environments.
Integration Phase: Gradually integrate updated components into the broader system, ensuring smooth interaction.
Validation Phase: Comprehensive testing to validate system stability and performance.
Deployment Phase: Roll out the updated Python versions across all environments.
