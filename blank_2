Certainly! To create a basic machine learning Python script for audio classification using the `librosa` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install librosa numpy scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Import Libraries:**
   Import the required libraries in your Python script:
   ```python
   import librosa
   import librosa.display
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   from sklearn.svm import SVC
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
   ```

3. **Load and Extract Features from Audio Files:**
   ```python
   def extract_features(file_path):
       # Load audio file
       y, sr = librosa.load(file_path)
       
       # Extract features
       chroma_stft = np.mean(librosa.feature.chroma_stft(y=y, sr=sr))
       rmse = np.mean(librosa.feature.rms(y=y))
       spectral_centroid = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y=y, sr=sr))
       # Add more features as needed

       return [chroma_stft, rmse, spectral_centroid]  # Adjust based on your feature set
   ```

4. **Prepare Dataset:**
   ```python
   def load_data(file_paths, labels):
       features = []
       for file_path in file_paths:
           features.append(extract_features(file_path))
       
       X = np.array(features)
       y = np.array(labels)
       
       return X, y
   ```

5. **Train a Classifier:**
   ```python
   def train_classifier(X_train, y_train):
       scaler = StandardScaler()
       X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
       
       clf = SVC(kernel='linear')  # You can choose a different classifier
       clf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
       
       return clf
   ```

6. **Evaluate the Model:**
   ```python
   def evaluate_model(clf, X_test, y_test):
       X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
       y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_scaled)
       
       accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
       report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
       
       return accuracy, report
   ```

7. **Main Script:**
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Define your file paths and labels
       file_paths = [...]  # List of audio file paths
       labels = [...]  # List of corresponding labels

       # Split data into training and testing sets
       X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(file_paths, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

       # Load and preprocess data
       X_train, y_train = load_data(X_train, y_train)
       X_test, y_test = load_data(X_test, y_test)

       # Train the classifier
       clf = train_classifier(X_train, y_train)

       # Evaluate the model
       accuracy, report = evaluate_model(clf, X_test, y_test)

       print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
       print("Classification Report:\n", report)
   ```

Adjust the script based on your specific requirements, such as changing the features, classifier, or incorporating a deep learning model if needed. Additionally, make sure to handle audio file paths and labels appropriately for your dataset.
