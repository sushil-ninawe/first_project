Certainly! To create a basic machine learning Python script for audio classification using the `librosa` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install librosa numpy scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Import Libraries:**
   Import the required libraries in your Python script:
   ```python
   import librosa
   import librosa.display
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   from sklearn.svm import SVC
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
   ```

3. **Load and Extract Features from Audio Files:**
   ```python
   def extract_features(file_path):
       # Load audio file
       y, sr = librosa.load(file_path)
       
       # Extract features
       chroma_stft = np.mean(librosa.feature.chroma_stft(y=y, sr=sr))
       rmse = np.mean(librosa.feature.rms(y=y))
       spectral_centroid = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y=y, sr=sr))
       # Add more features as needed

       return [chroma_stft, rmse, spectral_centroid]  # Adjust based on your feature set
   ```

4. **Prepare Dataset:**
   ```python
   def load_data(file_paths, labels):
       features = []
       for file_path in file_paths:
           features.append(extract_features(file_path))
       
       X = np.array(features)
       y = np.array(labels)
       
       return X, y
   ```

5. **Train a Classifier:**
   ```python
   def train_classifier(X_train, y_train):
       scaler = StandardScaler()
       X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
       
       clf = SVC(kernel='linear')  # You can choose a different classifier
       clf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
       
       return clf
   ```

6. **Evaluate the Model:**
   ```python
   def evaluate_model(clf, X_test, y_test):
       X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
       y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_scaled)
       
       accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
       report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
       
       return accuracy, report
   ```

7. **Main Script:**
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Define your file paths and labels
       file_paths = [...]  # List of audio file paths
       labels = [...]  # List of corresponding labels

       # Split data into training and testing sets
       X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(file_paths, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

       # Load and preprocess data
       X_train, y_train = load_data(X_train, y_train)
       X_test, y_test = load_data(X_test, y_test)

       # Train the classifier
       clf = train_classifier(X_train, y_train)

       # Evaluate the model
       accuracy, report = evaluate_model(clf, X_test, y_test)

       print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
       print("Classification Report:\n", report)
   ```

Adjust the script based on your specific requirements, such as changing the features, classifier, or incorporating a deep learning model if needed. Additionally, make sure to handle audio file paths and labels appropriately for your dataset.




Certainly, you can enhance the feature set to add more sophistication. Here's an extended version of the `extract_features` function with additional features:

```python
def extract_features(file_path):
    y, sr = librosa.load(file_path)

    # Feature extraction
    chroma_stft = np.mean(librosa.feature.chroma_stft(y=y, sr=sr))
    rmse = np.mean(librosa.feature.rms(y=y))
    spectral_centroid = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y=y, sr=sr))
    spectral_bandwidth = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_bandwidth(y=y, sr=sr))
    rolloff = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_rolloff(y=y, sr=sr))
    zero_crossing_rate = np.mean(librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate(y))

    # Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
    mfccs = np.mean(librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13), axis=1)

    # Additional rhythm features
    tempogram = np.mean(librosa.feature.tempogram(y=y, sr=sr), axis=1)

    # Combine all features into a single list
    features = [chroma_stft, rmse, spectral_centroid, spectral_bandwidth, rolloff,
                zero_crossing_rate, *mfccs, *tempogram]

    return features
```

This version includes additional features such as spectral bandwidth, spectral rolloff, zero-crossing rate, and MFCCs. You can adjust the number of MFCCs (`n_mfcc`) and experiment with other features provided by `librosa` based on your specific use case.

Remember to update the `load_data` function to handle the increased feature dimensions:

```python
def load_data(file_paths, labels):
    features = [extract_features(file_path) for file_path in file_paths]
    X = np.array(features)
    y = np.array(labels)
    return X, y
```

Adapting the model training and evaluation functions may also be necessary depending on the changes made to the feature set.gy








fuzzy
Certainly! You can use the `fuzzywuzzy` library in Python to perform fuzzy matching between transaction names and employee names. First, you need to install the library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install fuzzywuzzy
```

Here's an example code snippet on how you can perform fuzzy matching and filter transactions based on a threshold:

```python
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz

# Assuming emp_dict is your employee dictionary with emp_full_name as keys
# and tran_df is your transaction DataFrame with tran_full_name column

emp_dict = {'emp_id1': 'John Doe', 'emp_id2': 'Jane Smith', 'emp_id3': 'Bob Johnson'}

# Assuming tran_df is a DataFrame with 'tran_id' and 'tran_full_name' columns
tran_df = pd.DataFrame({'tran_id': [1, 2, 3], 'tran_full_name': ['John D', 'Jane S', 'Bob J']})

# Set the threshold for fuzzy matching
threshold = 70

# Function to find matching employee for a transaction
def find_matching_employee(tran_name):
    matches = [(emp_name, fuzz.ratio(tran_name, emp_name)) for emp_name in emp_dict.values()]
    matches_above_threshold = [match[0] for match in matches if match[1] >= threshold]
    return matches_above_threshold

# Apply the function to the transaction DataFrame
tran_df['matching_employees'] = tran_df['tran_full_name'].apply(find_matching_employee)

# Filter transactions with at least one matching employee
matched_transactions = tran_df[tran_df['matching_employees'].apply(lambda x: len(x) > 0)]

# Display the result
print(matched_transactions)
```

This code calculates the fuzzy ratio between each transaction name and employee name and includes transactions in the result DataFrame if at least one employee name has a fuzzy ratio greater than or equal to the specified threshold. Adjust the `emp_dict` and `tran_df` accordingly based on your actual data.






# Flatten the multi-index columns into a single-level index
pivot_table_reset.columns = ['{}_{}'.format(col[0], col[1]) for col in pivot_table_reset.columns]








import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {'client_prod_num': [101, 202, 303],
        'emp_prod_num': [[101, 102, 103], [201, 202, 203], [301, 302, 303]]}

# Creating DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Creating the 'flag' column
df['flag'] = df.apply(lambda row: 1 if row['client_prod_num'] in row['emp_prod_num'] else 0, axis=1)

# Displaying the DataFrame
print(df)
