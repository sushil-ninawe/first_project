Certainly! To create a basic machine learning Python script for audio classification using the `librosa` library, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install librosa numpy scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Import Libraries:**
   Import the required libraries in your Python script:
   ```python
   import librosa
   import librosa.display
   import numpy as np
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   from sklearn.svm import SVC
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
   ```

3. **Load and Extract Features from Audio Files:**
   ```python
   def extract_features(file_path):
       # Load audio file
       y, sr = librosa.load(file_path)
       
       # Extract features
       chroma_stft = np.mean(librosa.feature.chroma_stft(y=y, sr=sr))
       rmse = np.mean(librosa.feature.rms(y=y))
       spectral_centroid = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y=y, sr=sr))
       # Add more features as needed

       return [chroma_stft, rmse, spectral_centroid]  # Adjust based on your feature set
   ```

4. **Prepare Dataset:**
   ```python
   def load_data(file_paths, labels):
       features = []
       for file_path in file_paths:
           features.append(extract_features(file_path))
       
       X = np.array(features)
       y = np.array(labels)
       
       return X, y
   ```

5. **Train a Classifier:**
   ```python
   def train_classifier(X_train, y_train):
       scaler = StandardScaler()
       X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
       
       clf = SVC(kernel='linear')  # You can choose a different classifier
       clf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
       
       return clf
   ```

6. **Evaluate the Model:**
   ```python
   def evaluate_model(clf, X_test, y_test):
       X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
       y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_scaled)
       
       accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
       report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
       
       return accuracy, report
   ```

7. **Main Script:**
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Define your file paths and labels
       file_paths = [...]  # List of audio file paths
       labels = [...]  # List of corresponding labels

       # Split data into training and testing sets
       X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(file_paths, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

       # Load and preprocess data
       X_train, y_train = load_data(X_train, y_train)
       X_test, y_test = load_data(X_test, y_test)

       # Train the classifier
       clf = train_classifier(X_train, y_train)

       # Evaluate the model
       accuracy, report = evaluate_model(clf, X_test, y_test)

       print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
       print("Classification Report:\n", report)
   ```

Adjust the script based on your specific requirements, such as changing the features, classifier, or incorporating a deep learning model if needed. Additionally, make sure to handle audio file paths and labels appropriately for your dataset.




Certainly, you can enhance the feature set to add more sophistication. Here's an extended version of the `extract_features` function with additional features:

```python
def extract_features(file_path):
    y, sr = librosa.load(file_path)

    # Feature extraction
    chroma_stft = np.mean(librosa.feature.chroma_stft(y=y, sr=sr))
    rmse = np.mean(librosa.feature.rms(y=y))
    spectral_centroid = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y=y, sr=sr))
    spectral_bandwidth = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_bandwidth(y=y, sr=sr))
    rolloff = np.mean(librosa.feature.spectral_rolloff(y=y, sr=sr))
    zero_crossing_rate = np.mean(librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate(y))

    # Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
    mfccs = np.mean(librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13), axis=1)

    # Additional rhythm features
    tempogram = np.mean(librosa.feature.tempogram(y=y, sr=sr), axis=1)

    # Combine all features into a single list
    features = [chroma_stft, rmse, spectral_centroid, spectral_bandwidth, rolloff,
                zero_crossing_rate, *mfccs, *tempogram]

    return features
```

This version includes additional features such as spectral bandwidth, spectral rolloff, zero-crossing rate, and MFCCs. You can adjust the number of MFCCs (`n_mfcc`) and experiment with other features provided by `librosa` based on your specific use case.

Remember to update the `load_data` function to handle the increased feature dimensions:

```python
def load_data(file_paths, labels):
    features = [extract_features(file_path) for file_path in file_paths]
    X = np.array(features)
    y = np.array(labels)
    return X, y
```

Adapting the model training and evaluation functions may also be necessary depending on the changes made to the feature set.
