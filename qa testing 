When meeting with the QA head, you can frame the issue as follows:

Issue Articulation:

1. Limited QA Data Availability: Due to restricted access to representative data in the QA environment, it’s challenging to fully validate fraud detection rules and machine learning models. The data isn’t sufficient to cover the wide spectrum of cases, especially for fraud detection, where rare patterns and outliers are essential to test.


2. Stringent Rules Causing Data Bottlenecks: The rules and filters applied are highly restrictive, often preventing data from advancing through stages in the QA pipeline, which makes it challenging to identify potential flaws in the detection process.


3. High Complexity Due to Multiple Input Tables: With a high number of source tables, generating synthetic data that accurately represents the production environment is complicated. This often results in synthetic datasets that miss critical anomalies or outliers that could trigger fraud alerts.



Solution Proposal:

1. Data Sampling from Production for QA: Collaborate with the data and compliance teams to create a secure sampling process that anonymizes and samples data from the production environment. Even a small, representative sample can help replicate real-world fraud scenarios, while anonymization ensures compliance.


2. Flexible Rule Relaxation in QA: Work with the QA team to create an environment where certain rules can be temporarily relaxed. By implementing a “debug mode” or “rule bypass” specifically for QA, data can flow through different stages, enabling comprehensive testing of the pipeline without compromising rule integrity.


3. Automated Outlier Injection: Develop an automated process to inject synthetic outliers into the data pipeline. These outliers could be designed to mimic fraud indicators (based on patterns observed in production) and could be systematically tested within QA.


4. Modular QA Strategy with Real and Synthetic Data Mix: Create a hybrid testing approach in QA that uses a mix of real (anonymized) and synthetic data. This setup would allow the team to validate model performance on diverse data scenarios, covering both everyday and edge-case fraud situations.


5. Ongoing Collaboration and Regular Feedback Loops: Establish regular meetings with the QA team to iteratively refine this approach based on early testing outcomes.
