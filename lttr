In Hive, you can achieve this by using a combination of the `SELECT` statement along with the `LEFT JOIN` and `CASE` clauses. Here's an example query to check if two tables (`table1` and `table2`) are exactly the same:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count_diff
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM table1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM table2
) combined
LEFT JOIN table1 t1 ON combined.column1 = t1.column1
                     AND combined.column2 = t1.column2
                     -- Add more columns as needed
LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON combined.column1 = t2.column1
                     AND combined.column2 = t2.column2
                     -- Add more columns as needed
WHERE t1.column1 IS NULL OR t2.column1 IS NULL;
```

In this query:
- We combine the rows from both tables using `UNION ALL`.
- We then perform left joins on both `table1` and `table2` based on the columns that uniquely identify rows (you need to replace `column1`, `column2`, etc. with the actual column names you want to use).
- If a row exists in one table but not in the other, the corresponding joined table's columns will be `NULL`.
- The `WHERE` clause filters out rows where any of the joined table's columns are `NULL`.
- Finally, the query returns the count of differing rows. If the count is 0, the tables are exactly the same.

Keep in mind that this query assumes the two tables have the same structure and column names. Adjust the column names accordingly based on your table's schema.
