If all the hobbies are in a single row for each student, you can modify the PySpark recipe to split the hobbies into separate columns and then find the commonality. Here's how you can do that:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import split

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("HobbyIntersection").getOrCreate()

# Sample dataset (replace this with your actual dataset)
data = [("Student1", "New Hobby1, New Hobby2, New Hobby3", "Old Hobby1, Old Hobby2"),
        ("Student2", "New Hobby3, New Hobby4", "Old Hobby3, Old Hobby1"),
        ("Student3", "New Hobby1, New Hobby5", "Old Hobby2, Old Hobby4")]

# Define the schema for the dataset
schema = ["Student", "NewHobbies", "OldHobbies"]

# Create a DataFrame from the sample data
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=schema)

# Split the comma-separated hobbies into arrays
df = df.withColumn("NewHobbies", split(col("NewHobbies"), ", "))
df = df.withColumn("OldHobbies", split(col("OldHobbies"), ", "))

# Calculate the intersection of new and old hobbies
df = df.withColumn("CommonHobbies", array_intersect(col("NewHobbies"), col("OldHobbies")))

# Show the result
df.show(truncate=False)

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
```

In this modified code:
- We split the comma-separated hobby strings into arrays using `split`.
- Then, we calculate the intersection of the arrays of new and old hobbies using `array_intersect`.
- The result DataFrame will contain the common hobbies for each student, even when all hobbies are in a single row.

Again, replace the sample dataset with your actual data in your PySpark environment.
