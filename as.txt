Write a code to log the code artifact using mlflow where it captures the code from where it's being called
View other drafts













Sure, here is the code to log the code artifact using mlflow where it captures the code from where it's being called:

Python
import mlflow

# Start a run
with mlflow.start_run() as run:

    # Log the code artifact
    mlflow.log_artifact(open(__file__, 'rb'))

# Print the run information
print(run.info)
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code will log the current file, which is the file where the code is being called, as an artifact. The artifact will be stored in the MLflow tracking server. You can then view the artifact in the MLflow UI.

Here is an example of how to view the artifact in the MLflow UI:

Go to the MLflow UI.
Click on the "Experiments" tab.
Select the experiment that contains the run that you logged the artifact to.
Click on the "Runs" tab.
Select the run that you logged the artifact to.
Click on the "Artifacts" tab.
The artifact will be listed in the "Artifacts" tab.
You can also download the artifact by clicking on the "Download" button next to the artifact name.
